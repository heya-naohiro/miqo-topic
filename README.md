/Alpha/#

```

```mermaid

    C-->F[Foxtrot]

Each node may contain a value, assuming in the case of an MQTT broker, it might have a transmission channel.ã€€The same node can hold multiple values. This requirement corresponds to the scenario where multiple clients can subscribe to the same topic.

> Currently, the implementation is using RefCell and Rc, but for multi-threaded implementation, it will be necessary to switch to using Arc.
